<h1>The Best Movies According to Alperen</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my favourite sci-fi. In any case, there’s something pure and powerful about this movie. I can’t recall a science fiction film hard-sold to a director’s fans as multiplex-“awesome” in which so many major characters wept openly in close-up, voices breaking, tears streaming down their cheeks.</p>
<h3>The Truman Show</h3>
<p>Really cool movie. There is a reason The Truman Show was nominated for multiple awards including three Oscars. One of the film's most striking aspects is its prescient commentary on the omnipresence of media and the blurring of lines between reality and entertainment. "The Truman Show" was ahead of its time in addressing issues such as reality TV's voyeuristic nature, the commodification of personal lives, and the ethical boundaries of the media industry. These themes are arguably even more relevant in our current era of social media and reality television.</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Pulp Fiction, directed by Quentin Tarantino and released in 1994, is a film that defies convention, challenges storytelling norms."Pulp Fiction" is a film that challenges its viewers, both morally and intellectually. It raises questions about redemption, fate, and the consequences of one's actions. Despite its gritty subject matter and moments of extreme violence, the film invites audiences to find humor and humanity in the darkest corners of the criminal underworld.</p>
